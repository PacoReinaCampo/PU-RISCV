# DESIGN OF REGISTERS

The RISC-V ISA defines a set of registers to facilitate efficient data processing and control flow within a processor. These registers play crucial roles in storing operands, intermediate results, and control information during program execution. The design of registers in RISC-V is straightforward and aimed at providing a balance between performance, simplicity, and compatibility across different implementations.
