# DEFINITION

RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer Five) is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) designed with a focus on simplicity and modularity. It supports a wide range of implementations from small embedded devices to large-scale datacenter servers. RISC-V is characterized by its fixed instruction length (32 bits or 64 bits) and a small set of core instructions, aiming to provide a foundation for a variety of computing needs.
