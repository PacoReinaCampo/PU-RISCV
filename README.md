# PU-RISCV WIKI

A Processing Unit (PU) is an electronic system within a computer that carries out instructions of a program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specified by instructions. Instruction-level parallelism is a measure of how many instructions in a computer can be executed simultaneously. The PU is contained on a single Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Integrated Circuit (IC).

The RISC-V implementation has a 32/64/128 bit Microarchitecture, 6 stages data pipeline and an Instruction Set Architecture based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer. Compatible with AMBA and Wishbone Buses. For Researching and Developing.

```

### 1.2. Icarus Verilog
Verilog Hardware Description Language Simulator

*A Hardware Description Language Simulator uses mathematical models to replicate the behavior of an actual hardware device. Simulation software allows for modeling of circuit operation and is an invaluable analysis tool. Simulating a circuit’s behavior before actually building it can greatly improve design efficiency by making faulty designs known as such, and providing insight into the behavior of electronics circuit designs.*

```

### 1.3. GHDL
VHDL Hardware Description Language Simulator

*A Hardware Description Language Simulator uses mathematical models to replicate the behavior of an actual hardware device. Simulation software allows for modeling of circuit operation and is an invaluable analysis tool. Simulating a circuit’s behavior before actually building it can greatly improve design efficiency by making faulty designs known as such, and providing insight into the behavior of electronics circuit designs.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl

cd ghdl
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```

```
cd sim/vhdl/regression/wb/ghdl

```

### 1.4. Yosys-ABC
Verilog Hardware Description Language Synthesizer

*A Hardware Description Language Synthesizer turns a RTL implementation into a Logical Gate Level implementation. Logical design is a step in the standard design cycle in which the functional design of an electronic circuit is converted into the representation which captures logic operations, arithmetic operations, control flow, etc. In EDA parts of the logical design is automated using synthesis tools based on the behavioral description of the circuit.*

Hardware Description Language Optimizer

*A Hardware Description Language Optimizer finds an equivalent representation of the specified logic circuit under specified constraints (minimum area, pre-specified delay). This tool combines scalable logic optimization based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), optimal-delay DAG-based technology mapping for look-up tables and standard cells, and innovative algorithms for sequential synthesis and verification.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys

cd yosys

```

## 2. BACK-END Open Source Tools

### 2.1. Library

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install bison cmake flex freeglut3-dev libcairo2-dev libgsl-dev \
libncurses-dev libx11-dev m4 python-tk python3-tk swig tcl tcl-dev tk-dev tcsh
```

```
mkdir qflow
cd qflow
```

### 2.2. Magic
Floor-Planner

*A Floor-Planner of an Integrated Circuit (IC) is a schematic representation of tentative placement of its major functional blocks. In modern electronic design process floor-plans are created during the floor-planning design stage, an early stage in the hierarchical approach to Integrated Circuit design. Depending on the design methodology being followed, the actual definition of a floor-plan may differ.*

Standard Cell Checker

*A Standard Cell Checker is a geometric constraint imposed on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Integrated Circuit (IC) designers to ensure their designs function properly, reliably, and can be produced with acceptable yield. Design Rules for production are developed by hardware engineers based on the capability of their processes to realize design intent. Design Rule Checking (DRC) is used to ensure that designers do not violate design rules.*

Standard Cell Editor

*A Standard Cell Editor allows to print a set of standard cells. The standard cell methodology is an abstraction, whereby a low-level VLSI layout is encapsulated into a logical representation. A standard cell is a group of transistor and interconnect structures that provides a boolean logic function (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, inverters) or a storage function (flipflop or latch).*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic

cd magic
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 2.2. Graywolf
Standard Cell Placer

*A Standard Cell Placer takes a given synthesized circuit netlist together with a technology library and produces a valid placement layout. The layout is optimized according to the aforementioned objectives and ready for cell resizing and buffering, a step essential for timing and signal integrity satisfaction. Physical design flow are iterated a number of times until design closure is achieved.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/rubund/graywolf

cd graywolf
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### 2.3. OpenSTA
Standard Cell Timing-Analizer

*A Standard Cell Timing-Analizer is a simulation method of computing the expected timing of a digital circuit without requiring a simulation of the full circuit. High-performance integrated circuits have traditionally been characterized by the clock frequency at which they operate. Measuring the ability of a circuit to operate at the specified speed requires an ability to measure, during the design process, its delay at numerous steps.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA

cd OpenSTA
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### 2.4. Qrouter
Standard Cell Router

*A Standard Cell Router takes pre-existing polygons consisting of pins on cells, and pre-existing wiring called pre-routes. Each of these polygons are associated with a net. The primary task of the router is to create geometries such that all terminals assigned to the same net are connected, no terminals assigned to different nets are connected, and all design rules are obeyed.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/qrouter

cd qrouter
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 2.5. Irsim
Standard Cell Simulator

*A Standard Cell Simulator treats transistors as ideal switches. Extracted capacitance and lumped resistance values are used to make the switch a little bit more realistic than the ideal, using the RC time constants to predict the relative timing of events. This simulator represents a circuit in terms of its exact transistor structure but describes the electrical behavior in a highly idealized way.*

type:
```
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/irsim

cd irsim
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 2.6. Netgen
Standard Cell Verifier

*A Standard Cell Verifier compares netlists, a process known as LVS (Layout vs. Schematic). This step ensures that the geometry that has been laid out matches the expected circuit. The greatest need for LVS is in large analog or mixed-signal circuits that cannot be simulated in reasonable time. LVS can be done faster than simulation, and provides feedback that makes it easier to find errors.*

```
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/netgen

cd netgen
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## 6. CORE-RISCV


### 6.1. RISC PIPELINE

In computer science, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level parallelism within a PU. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps performed by different PUs with different parts of instructions processed in parallel. It allows faster PU throughput than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate.

| Typical    | Modified   | Module          |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| FETCH      | FETCH      | riscv_if        |
| ...        | PRE-DECODE | riscv_id        |
| DECODE     | DECODE     | riscv_id        |
| EXECUTE    | EXECUTE    | riscv_execution |
| MEMORY     | MEMORY     | riscv_memory    |
| WRITE-BACK | WRITE-BACK | riscv_wb        |

- IF – Instruction Fetch Unit : Send out the PC and fetch the instruction from memory into the Instruction Register (IR); increment the PC to address the next sequential instruction. The IR is used to hold the next instruction that will be needed on subsequent clock cycles; likewise the register NPC is used to hold the next sequential PC.

- ID – Instruction Decode Unit : Decode the instruction and access the register file to read the registers. This unit gets instruction from IF, and extracts opcode and operand from that instruction. It also retrieves register values if requested by the operation.

- EX – Execution Unit : The ALU operates on the operands prepared in prior cycle, performing one functions depending on instruction type.

- MEM – Memory Access Unit: Instructions active in this unit are loads, stores and branches.

- WB – WriteBack Unit : Write the result into the register file, whether it comes from the memory system or from the ALU.

### 6.2. CORE-RISCV Organization

The CORE-RISCV is based on the Harvard architecture, which is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. A Harvard architecture machine has distinct code and data address spaces: instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero. Instruction address zero might identify a twenty-four-bit value, while data address zero might indicate an eight-bit byte that is not part of that twenty-four-bit value.

| Core                         | Module description                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| riscv_core                   | Core                               |
|...riscv_if                   | Instruction Fetch                  |
|...riscv_id                   | Instruction Decoder                |
|...riscv_execution            | Execution Unit                     |
|.....riscv_alu                | Arithmetic & Logical Unit          |

|.....riscv_bu                 | Branch Unit                        |
|.....riscv_mul                | Multiplier Unit                    |
|.....riscv_div                | Division Unit                      |
|...riscv_memory               | Memory Unit                        |
|...riscv_wb                   | Data Memory Access (Write Back)    |
|...riscv_state                | State Unit                         |
|...riscv_rf                   | Register File                      |
|...riscv_bp                   | Correlating Branch Prediction Unit |
|.....riscv_ram_1r1w           | RAM 1RW1                           |
|.......riscv_ram_1r1w_generic | RAM 1RW1 Generic                   |
|...riscv_du                   | Debug Unit                         |

In a Harvard architecture, there is no need to make the two memories share characteristics. In particular, the word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory address structure can differ. In some systems, instructions for pre-programmed tasks can be stored in read-only memory while data memory generally requires read-write memory. In some systems, there is much more instruction memory than data memory so instruction addresses are wider than data addresses.

## 7. INSTRUCTION & DATA CACHE

A PU cache is a hardware cache used by the PU to reduce the average cost (time or energy) to access instruction/data from the main memory. A cache is a smaller, faster memory, closer to a core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. Most CPUs have different independent caches, including instruction and data caches.
